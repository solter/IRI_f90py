<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As part of its centennial celebrations, the Ebro Observatory
in Roquetes, Spain, hosted the 2005 International Reference Ionosphere (IRI)
Workshop. Workshop sessions, held at the Observatory and the <span
style='color:black'>Auditory Felip Pedrell in neighboring Tortosa from June 27
to July 1, covered the typical IRI topics: F-region Modeling, Bottomside
Parameters and Drifts, Topside Ionosphere, IRI Applications, Temperature and
Composition, Ionospheric Variability, Lower Ionosphere, Total Electron Content,
and New Inputs for IRI. The agenda included 66 presentations by 48 scientists
from 18 countries illustrating the global reach and importance of the IRI
activities. Ground and space data sources were evenly represented including
data from many ionosondes, and from most incoherent scatter radars, and from
the satellites Akebono, CHAMP, DMSP, GPS, Hinotori, IK-19, IK-24, IMAGE, ISIS,
JASON, Ohzora, ROCSAT, TIMED, TIROS/NOAA, and TOPEX, and from several rocket
flights. The meeting benefited from the excellent local support under the
leadership of Dr. David Altadill. The Observatory team not only patiently
shepherded the international group of scientists during the session periods,
but also arranged an evening walking tour of Tortosa and a conference excursion
to the beautiful Tortosa-Beseit Natural Park and the Picasso Center in Orta de
Sant Joan. Opening and closing ceremonies were attended by local and regional
politicians who pledged their support for the Observatory and acknowledged the
importance of holding this international science meeting in their town and
region. Financial support was provided by the following organizations:
Committee on Space Research (COSPAR), International Union of Radio Science
(URSI), European Office of Aerospace Research and Development (EOARD) of the US
Air Force Office of Scientific Research, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones
Cientificas (CSIC), Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia (MEC), Agència de Gestió
d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca (AGAUR) and by the Observatori de l'Ebre.
Also the Mayor's Offices of the Towns of Roquetes and Tortosa, the Council of
the Lower Ebro Area, La Caixa, the Ramon Llull University and Diario ABC
supported this event.</span></p>

<h2>Electron Density – Topside, Plasmasphere, and TEC</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The new version of IRI, due to be released later this year,
will include two options for the topside electron density: (1) the correction
term for the current IRI model as proposed by Bilitza (USA) and (2) the newest
version of the NeQuick model as presented by Coisson (Italy). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Reinisch (USA) explained his new
approach of representing the topside and plasmasphere electron densities by a
Chapman profile with continuously varying scale-height using the developing UML
plasmasphere model that is based on IMAGE/RPI and ISIS measurements.
Alternatively, Pulinets (Mexico) and Depuev (Russia) are proposing the use of
an Epstein function with variable scale-height and have successfully applied
this approach to their IK-19 topside sounder data. An important aspect of their
model is the inclusion of persistent longitudinal features. Uemoto (Japan)
presented Ohzora and Akebono topside sounder data as a possible source for
improvements of the IRI topside profile. Plasmaspheric extensions of IRI were
discussed by Coisson (Italy) and by Gulyaeva (Russia) using the Global Core
Plasma Model (GCPM) developed by Gallagher et al. (USA). Garner (USA) found
that binned DMSP data follow a lognormal distribution and he studied global and
solar activity variations of the distribution parameters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>There were quite a number of
presentations of TEC-related studies including: (1) Comparisons of GPS TEC with
ionosonde ITEC measurements (McKinnell, South Africa; Mosert, Argentina), (2)
Comparisons of TEC measurements with IRI predictions (Bhuyan, India; F. Arikan,
Turkey; Moeketsi, South Africa; Opperman, South Africa). (3) Ionospheric
tomography techniques and their utilization of IRI (O. Arikan, Turkey; Bhuyan,
India; Opperman, South Africa), (4) Ionospheric data obtained by different
dual-frequency space techniques and their use for improvements of IRI (Bilitza,
USA), (5) An assessment of 2<sup>nd</sup> order ionospheric effects on GPS
measurements (Hernandez-Pajares, Spain), (6) Using a wavelet/spline approach as
an initial step of a multi-resolution representation of TEC (Schmidt, Germany)
(6) A method for deducing foF2 from GPS-TEC (Krankowski, Poland). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Electron Density – F-peak and below</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The main new input for the next version of IRI will be the
spread-F occurrence model for the South-American sector that was developed by
Abdu (Brazil) based on ionosonde data. Efforts are under way to develop a
quantitative description of ionospheric variability in terms of quartiles and
deciles for inclusion in IRI (Mosert, Argentina; Altadill, Spain).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>In IRI the height of the F2 peak is
computed from the M(3000)F2 factor that is regularly measured by ionosondes. A
study by M. Zhang (China) showed that the shortcomings of IRI in representing
the sunrise and post-sunset peaks in hmF2 are a result of the shortcomings of
the CCIR model used for M(3000)F2. Good agreement is obtained when using the
ionosonde-measured M(3000)F2. McKinnell (South Africa) reported about her
effort in developing a neural network (NN) model for M(3000)F2, which could
eventually replace the CCIR model and its shortcomings. The quality of IRI
predictions during ionospheric storms was evaluated with a variety of ionosonde
data (Mosert, Argentina; Araujo-Pradere, USA; Miro, Italy). Peronne (Italy)
presented a storm-time modeling approach based on a time-weighted magnetic
accumulation index. A validation of TIMED/GUVI nighttime electron density
profiles with worldwide ionosonde data was presented by DeMajistre (USA). Good
agreement was found for most stations making the GUVI profiles a promising new
data source for IRI nighttime improvements.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The diurnal, seasonal, and solar
cycle variations of bottomside profile parameters were studied by Mosert
(Argentina) and by Blanch (Spain) based on ionosonde data with the goal of
improving the current representation in IRI. Altadill (Spain) is proposing
analytical functions to replace the current tabular form in which these
parameters are provided in IRI. He also used such functions to represent
vertical drift measurements from the Ebro digisonde.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>E-region modeling is focusing on
the auroral region and a representation of the enhanced foE due to particle
precipitation (Fuller-Rowell, USA, NOAA/Tiros data; Mertens, USA; TIMED/SABER
data). McKinnell (South Africa) is proposing a NN approach to modeling the
density distribution in the auroral zone lower ionosphere. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IRI
currently includes Friedrich’s (Austria) FIRI model as a separate option for
the D-region electron density only. But the model is forced to agree with the
IRI E-peak. This results in E-region values that are quite different from the
original data-based FIRI predictions. It was therefore decided to decouple the
FIRI model option from the E-peak constraint and make it accessible all the way
to 140 km. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Plasma Temperatures, Ion Composition, and Ion Drift </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next version of IRI will include several new inputs: (1)
a model for the plasmaspheric electron temperature based on Akebono data
(Kutiev, Bulgaria and Oyama, Japan), (2) the TTS model for the topside ion
composition based on IK-24 and AE-C,-E data (Triskova and Truhlik, Czech
Republic), (3) a model for the storm-time vertical ion drift (Scherliess and
Fejer, USA). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Su (Taiwan) presented new models
deduced from ROCSAT satellite data (high solar activity) describing the topside
ion density, the distribution of density irregularity, the ion temperature, and
the equatorial vertical ion drift. Empirical models for parameters from 7
incoherent scatter radars have been develop by S. Zhang (USA) in conjunction
with the radar groups. This will be a valuable evaluation tool for the IRI
model performance at the radar locations. Kutiev (Bulgaria) has combined his
model for the topside ion transition height with his topside scale-height model
to provide a topside profiler for ionosondes. Bilitza (USA) and Truhlik (Czech
Republic) used a large data base of satellite in-situ measurements to
investigate the altitudinal, latitudinal, and seasonal differences in the solar
cycle variation of electron temperatures and densities and found good agreement
when comparing the observed trends with those predicted by the FLIP model. They
also tested various solar indices and found best results with F10.7 and
PF10.7=(F10.7+F10.7A)/2 where F10.7A is the 81-day average. The IRI Te model
currently does not include solar cycle variations.  Other temperature features
not currently included in the IRI model were also pointed out. Oyama (Japan)
reminded participants that rocket observations of large differences between
electron temperature and neutral temperature around 100 km are not yet
explained and are not included in IRI. Watanabe (Japan) using CHAMP
observations finds high electron densities around 70<span style='font-family:
Symbol'>°</span> latitudes at noon and enhanced thermospheric mass density and
high electron temperature in the cusp region (75<span style='font-family:Symbol'>°</span>-80<span
style='font-family:Symbol'>°</span>). The shortcomings of the IRI ion
temperature and ion composition model in representing some characteristic
longitudinal and diurnal features were noted by Chao (Taiwan) in comparisons of
IRI with ROCSAT data.</p>

<h2>Meetings, Publications, New Member</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Selected papers from the 2003 IRI Workshop in Grahamstown,
South Africa were published as Number 9 of Volume 34 of Advances in Space
Research (ASR) including 35 contributions and a dedication and paper in honor
of Prof. Karl Rawer’s 90<sup>th</sup> birthday. There was also a special
session during the German National URSI meeting (Kleinheubacher Tagung)
celebrating Karl Rawer and his contribution to the IRI effort. The papers from
that session were published as the 2<sup>nd</sup> Volume of Advances in
Radioscience (Kleinheubacher Berichte 2003). The reviewing process for the
presentation from the 2004 IRI session during the COSPAR General Assembly in
Paris, France is nearing completion and the dedicated ASR issue will be coming out
later this year. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
next IRI meeting will be held during the COSPAR General Assembly in Beijing,
China (16-23 July, 2006) on the topic of “Solar Cycle Variations of Ionospheric
Parameters”. On behalf of her Argentine colleagues M. Mosert invited the IRI
team to consider holding a special IRI Workshop in Buenos Aires, Argentina in
late 2006 recommending a TEC/GPS-related IRI meeting topic. Her proposal was
received favorably and she will explore the financial and logistics issues
connected to such a meeting. Buresova (Czech Republic) provided the
participants with more information about the Institute of Atmospheric Physics
in Prague, the venue for the 2007 IRI workshop. Possible dates were discussed
including a coupling to the IUGG meeting in Perugia, Italy, from July 2 to 13,
2007. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof.
Shin-Yi Su from the Institute of Space Science and Center for Space and Remote Sensing Research of the National Central
University in Chang-Li, Taiwan was elected as new member to the IRI Working
Group. </p>
