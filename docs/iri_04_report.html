<p class=MsoNormal><b>Report / Dieter Bilitza<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This session was organized by the International Reference
Ionosphere (IRI) Working Group with the goal of improving the description of
the electron and ion temperature and the ion composition in the IRI model. The
62 presentations were divided into sessions entitled: Plasma Temperatures –
Measurements and Models I, II, Modeling the Ionospheric Ion composition,
Topside Ionosphere and TEC, Electron Density Below the Peak, Description of
Disturbed Conditions, and Posters. A wide array of data sources was used in
these studies including satellite data from SROSS C2, CHAMP, GPS, SNOE, SORCE,
TIMED, COSMOS 1809, Interkosmos 19, Rocsat, Kompsat 1, Akebono, ACTIVE, ISS-b,
DE, AE-C,D,E, OGO-6, AEROS, ISIS, Alouette,<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Incoherent Scatter Radar (ISR) data from Saint Santin,
Millstone Hill, Irkutsk, and EISCAT, MST Radar data, Ionosonde data, and Rocket
measurements. The global reach of the IRI effort was documented by
presentations from many different countries including Argentina, Austria,
Brazil, Bulgaria, China, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, India, Italy,
Ivory Coast, Japan, Korea, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Taiwan, UK, and
USA.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Financial support was
provided by the Committee on Space Research<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>(COSPAR) and by the International Union of Radioscience
(URSI).</p>

<h1>Plasma temperatures</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Several new models were presented for the electron
temperature (Te) and ion temperature (Ti). Bhuyan et al. (India) used data from
SROSS C2 to study variation of Te with local time, season and solar activity in
the area covered by the satellite (~400 km, low latitudes, 1994-1998) and to
develop a model for solar cycle minimum conditions. The climatology of Te and
Ti recorded by the French Incoherent Scatter Radar in Saint Santin over more
than 2 decades was represented in an empirical model by S.R. Zhang et al.
(USA). Data from the first Taiwanese satellite, ROCSAT-1 were used by Chao et
al. (Taiwan) to construct a Ti model including seasonal, diurnal, longitudinal,
and latitudinal variations at 600 km. Truhlik et al. (Czech Republic) pointed
out ways of improving the IRI plasma temperature models in particular including
the dependence on solar activity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nighttime data from the Korean KOMPSAT-1 satellite at 685 km
are 200 to 400 K higher than the IRI predictions, whereas the electron
densities are somewhat lower than IRI (Min et al., Korea). Oyama et al. (Japan)
succeeded in taking on of the first Te measurements within a sporadic E layer
and reported a lowering of Te within the thin layer. Studying polar conditions
with Akebono data, Abe et al. (Japan) find a positive gradient for Te
increasing with altitude and Bz. Data from a rocket launched in Norway up to
767 km, show elevated electron temperatures associated with energetic particle
precipitation in the cusp (Steigies et al., Germany). Murilakrishna’s (Brazil)
rocket measurements show larger Te within plasma bubbles than outside. Proelss
et al. (Germany) noted the importance of including the Te enhancement in IRI
that is observed under the magnetospheric cleft region and they presented first
modeling results. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Richards (USA) focused on the nighttime behavior of Te and
Ne at mid-latitudes (Millstone Hill) and studied how well his Field Line
Interhemispheric Plasma (FLIP) model and the IRI model reproduce the observed
features. The main un-modeled feature is a post-midnight Ne enhancement that
correlates with a sharp drop in Te. A possible explanation might be a large
downward flow of ions facilitated by the decreasing temperatures. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IRI efforts are now focusing on including a full description
of solar cycle variations for the plasma temperatures, on developing an
independent Ti model, and on coupling with plasmaspheric temperature models. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1>Ion Composition and Densities</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Triskova et al. (Czech Republic) presented models for the
absolute ion densities of O<sup>+</sup>, H<sup>+</sup>, and He<sup>+</sup>
based on data from ACTIVE, AE, and OGO-6 and showed discrepancies with the
current IRI model. Many of these discrepancies are due to shortcomings of the
IRI electron density topside model (see next section), which is used to obtain
the individual ion densities from the IRI ion composition percentages. Another
source of error is the constant light ion ratio n(He+)/n(H+)=1/9 currently
assumed in IRI. This was also pointed out by Sidorova (Russia), who found large
differences between the He+ densities measured by ISS-b and predicted by IRI. A
better description of the light ion ratio was proposed at an earlier IRI
Workshop by Truhlik et al. (Czech Republic) and is now being considered for
inclusion in IRI.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the F-region which is dominated by O+ ions IRI performs
generally quite well. This was also confirmed by Bhuyan (India) who studied the
diurnal, seasonal and latitudinal variations of SROSS-C2 ion densities and
compared them with IRI. Lathuillere and Kofman (France) discussed the different
EISCAT measurement programs, the accuracy of deduced ion densities, and how
these data can be used for studying the ion composition behavior in the auroral
and polar ionosphere</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1>Electron Density – Topside and TEC</h1>

<h1><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ISIS/Alouette topside sounder Ne data sets available
from the National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) were used for a variety of
studies. Kutiev et al. (Bulgaria) developed a new model for the topside
ionosphere scale height (TISH) as a function of month, local time, latitude,
longitude and solar flux F10.7. Comparisons by Belehaki et al. (Greece) show
that TISH is in general agreement with scale heights deduced from ground
ionosondes but the model predicts post-midnight and afternoon maxima whereas
the ionosonde data show a noon maximum. Webb et al. (USA) reported on their
effort to deduce changes in the plasma temperature and ion composition from
changes in the ISIS/Alouette topside profiles. Using the sounder data Coisson
et al. (Italy) discussed limitations and possible improvements of the IRI
topside model and the NeQuick model.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reinisch and Huang (USA) showed how the topside scale height
for IRI can be obtained from the bottomside profile using the technique
developed for their Digisonde measurements. Stankov (Bulgaria) and Jakowski
(Germany) used CHAMP radio occultation data to deduce topside scale heights and
plan to develop a model based on these data.</p>

<h1><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-weight:normal'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>M.L. Zhang et al., (PR China) compared TEC derived from
Digisonde measurements at a low latitude station in China with GPS maps (IGS)
and with IRI predictions. The Digisonde TEC shows a somewhat better agreement
with the IGS values. Of course, the IGS TEC includes also a plasmaspheric
contribution that is not included with the other two methods. The properties of
the TEC in the equator anomaly region were studied with GPS data by Wan et al.
(PR China).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The main focus of future IRI activities is on improvements
of the topside electron density profile using a Chapman approach with variable
scale height and on merging the topside profile with a plasmaspheric model. </p>

<h1><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></h1>

<h1>Electron Density – F peak</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Abdu et al. (Brazil) compared the evening F layer peak
height and vertical drift from several Brazilian ionosonde stations with the
IRI predictions and find that the ion drift peak is often underestimated by IRI
whereas the F peak density is overestimated.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<h1><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-weight:normal'>Comparisons with Japanese
ionosonde data show good agreement with IRI except for small discrepancies of
the electron density at sunset (Tsujita et al., Japan). </span><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Real-time updating of IRI bottomside profiles for the
European sector with ionosonde data was discussed by Buresova et al. (Czech Republic)
and Stanislawska et al. (Poland). An improved algorithm for IRI-TEC updating
was presented by Pelevin et al. (Russia)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Studies of ionospheric variability continued with data from
ionosondes in Africa (Obrou et al., Ivory Coast), Europe (Mosert et al.,
Argentina) and Japan (Ezquer et al., Argentina). A first order variability
model for IRI is currently under development based on inputs from the ground
and topside ionosondes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;A first order variability model for IRI is currently
under development based</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>on input from the ground ionosondes (Fotiadis and Kouris)
and topside</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ionosondes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have presented a paper on : relation between TEC and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>peak density which I submitted for consideration and
publication in Adv.Space Res. In this work there was reported the results on</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the diurnal and seasonal variations of slab thickness and
the variability of TEC , using mainly hourly daily<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>GPS data from Matera</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>( Italy ) and Hailsham ( England) . Specifications on these
variations are also given in relation with those in foF2.</p>

<h1><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></h1>

<h1>Electron Density – Bottomside and Below</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>New models for the electron density in the lower ionosphere
at auroral latitudes were presented by Danilov (Russia) and McKinnell
(South-Africa). Danilov describes variations in the D-region in terms of solar
zenith angle and daily sum of Kp based on rocket data from the Northern and
Southern hemisphere. McKinnell applied a Neural Network approach to a combined
data base of rocket and EISCAT ISR data. Friedrich et al. (Austria) have
combined EISCAT-Svalbard data with polar-latitude rocket data to investigate
the “true quiet” electron density profile in the D, E and F regions; this is
the minimum envelope of all data. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Solomon (USA) investigated how well theoretical models
represent the E-region ionosphere when fed with accurate solar irradiances. He
found that the EUVAC solar irradiance model is in better agreement with SNOE,
TIMED/SEE and SORCE measurements than the Hinteregger EUV model. But even with
the EUVAC model the theoretical model still underestimates IRI and ionosonde E
peak densities particularly at solar minimum.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>IRI predictions agree overall quite well with data from the
Irkutsk ISR (1997 - 2003) (Potekhin et al., Russia) and the Irkutsk ionosonde
(Ratovsky et al., Russia), some overestimation is found during summer and
underestimation during winter. Lei et al. (PR China) compared the bottomside
parameters B0, B1 deduced from Millstone Hill and EISCAT measurements with IRI
and pointed out needed improvements. </p>
