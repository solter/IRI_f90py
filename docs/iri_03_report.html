<p class=MsoTitle>IRI 2003 Workshop</p>

<p class=MsoSubtitle>Meeting Report / Dieter Bilitza</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>With the 2003 Workshop the
International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) team convened for the first time on
the African continent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The meeting
was held at Rhodes University in Grahamstown, South Africa from October 6 to
10. The primary topic of the workshop was<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>“Quantifying Ionospheric Variability”. The workshop agenda included 38
papers authored by scientists from Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil,
Bulgaria, Canada, Cuba, Czech Republic, India, Italy, Japan, Nigeria, South
Africa, Spain, U.K., and USA. The talks were grouped into sessions entitled
“Lower and Bottomside Ionosphere”, “Ionospheric Variability”, “Total Electron
Content”, “IRI Applications and Latest Results”, “Topside Ionosphere”,
“Equatorial Ionosphere”, and “Final Discussions”.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.3in'>The local
organizing committee (L.-A. McKinnell, A. Poole) provided excellent support
with all aspects of the meeting including transportation and accommodation
arrangements. A special thank you goes to L.-A. McKinnell who made this
workshop possible through her dedication and untiring efforts before, during,
and after the meeting. An excursion to the Schotia Game Reserve was one of the
many highlights of this memorable workshop. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Financial
support for the workshop was provided by Rhodes University, the Grintek Ewation
Company, the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP),
the International Union of Radio Science (URSI), the Committee on Space
Research (COSPAR), Hermann Ohlthaver Institute for Aeronomy (HOIA), the South
African National Research Foundation (NRF) and the US National Science
Foundation (NSF). ICTP is an organization funded by the United Nations
Education, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and the Italian Government. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
follows is a brief summary of the workshop presentations and discussions with
special emphasis on the decisions made regarding the next version of the IRI
model. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1>VARIABILITY</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.3in'>Several speakers
presented results from the IRI Task Force Activity that meets annually at the
ICTP and that in recent years has focused on the development of a variability
model for IRI. Bilitza (USA) provided a progress report and pointed out some of
the roadblocks that still have to be overcome. Currently the relative
inter-quartile range (RIQ=[upper quartile – lower quartile]/median) is used as
measure of monthly variability and the ionospheric parameters considered
include foF2, hmF2, foF1, foE, M3000F2, B0, B1, D1, and TEC. RIQ alone,
however, is not sufficient since it does not describe the often highly
unsymmetrical distribution of data with respect to the monthly median. Upper
and lower quartiles and/or deciles could be used to better characterize the
data distribution. Bradley (U.K) pointed to his earlier studies that had shown
that the data distribution could<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>be quite well represented based on the upper and lower deciles. Mosert
(Argentina) and Amarante (Spain/Italy) reported about their variability studies
using South American and European ionosonde data, respectively, and also about
the efforts of Cuban colleagues (Alazo, Lazo, and Calzadilla) using data from
the ionosonde CD-ROM of the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC). Generally
they find that RIQ is larger at night than during daytime reaching the highest
values during sunrise, that it decreases with increasing solar activity, and
that it increases towards high latitudes with a latitudinal maximum often found
near the crests of the equator anomaly. Significant deviations from these
general trends, however, are found for individual stations and need to be
resolved before a variability model can be established. These discrepancies may
be also related to the very disturbing data problems (missing data, repeated
values, extra data, etc.) that were reported by Weatherhead (USA). She had
encountered these problems during her statistical studies of long-term trends
involving large amounts of ionosonde data from NGDC. A prime focus of such
long-term studies is to look for the ionospheric imprint of the tropospheric
greenhouse effect. Cannon’s (U.K.) study of 50 years of E and F peak parameters
collected by the Tromso (Norway) ionosonde finds a decreasing trend for all
parameters as would be expected from the greenhouse effect (cooling of the
mesosphere). Other earlier studies involving many stations have found positive
as well as negative trends. Recognizing the importance of data quality control
for such long-term studies as well as the IRI-related variability studies, the IRI
team will urge NGDC to address these issues. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.3in'>The workshop
provided a good review of prior efforts to quantitatively describe ionospheric
variability, especially for radio wave propagation applications (Bradley, U.K.;
Wilkinson, Australia; Mosert, Argentina). Specifically mentioned were two
models that provide relative deciles for different times and location: (1) the
tabulation of values by Davis and Groome (1964) and (2) the decile factors
recommended by ITU-R (1997). Comparing these models with measurements from an
Australian ionosonde Wilkinson (Australia) finds slightly better agreement with
the ITU-R (1997) model.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.3in'>Bradley (U.K.)
presented results from a European study (Kouris and Fotiadis, Greece;
Stanislawska and Juchnikowski, Poland) that looked at variability of different
ionospheric parameters and the correlation between these variabilities. They
find that the variability of foF2 clearly exceeds the variability of foE, foF1
and M(3000)F2 and that no strong correlations exist between the variabilities
of these parameters. Codrescu (USA) presented the results of a study by
Araujo-Pradere and Fuller-Rowell (USA) who used ionosonde data from 43 storm
periods to study the changes in variability with varying magnetic activity.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Studying the variability in the
bottomside ionosphere at different heights Amarante (Spain/Italy) and
colleagues confirmed the variability maximum just below the F2 peak (a result
of the very steep gradients in this region). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.3in'>Truhlik (Czech
Republic) used data from the ACTIVE mission to study the variability of the ion
composition and the electron temperature in the altitude range from 500 to 2500
km. The variability is generally greater during night than during day and
increases with latitude and altitude. Codrescu (USA) reminded the participants
about the strong variability of the equatorial ion drift and used a coupled
thermosphere-ionosphere-plasmasphere model to investigate possible sources for
this variability (neutral wind changes and their resultant dynamo action).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.3in'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h2><span style='text-transform:uppercase'>Electron Density<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b><u>D-Region:</u></b><span
style='font-weight:normal'> With IRI-2000 two new options were introduced for
this region (models by Friedrich, Austria, and Danilov, Russia). But users have
had considerable technical problems with this part of the IRI-2000 program
because of the large BLOCKDATA statements and the differences of various
FORTRAN compilers in dealing with these statements. An additional problem is
the fact that only the older D-region model provides a seamless merging with
the rest of the profile, whereas the two new options do not. It was decided to
generate a special D-region version of IRI with all three options and to only
include the older D-region model in the full model version. A new and promising
Neural Networks (NN) approach to modeling the auroral D- and E-region was presented
by McKinnell (South Africa). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b><u>E-Region:</u></b><span
style='font-weight:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nighttime remains a problem because of the scarcity of reliable data.
Theoretical computations (e.g., Titheridge, 2003) predict higher nighttime
values than IRI. Abdu (Brazil) found that he also needed to increase the
nighttime IRI foE values (E-region conductivity) to get agreement between
measured and computed values of the F2 peak height and ion drift.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b><u>F Peak and Bottomside:</u></b><span
style='font-weight:normal'> The shape of the IRI bottomside profile is defined
by the F2 bottomside thickness (B0) and shape (B1) parameters and by the F1
layer thickness parameter D1. Ionosonde measurements from Pruhonice (Czech
Republic) show overall good agreement with IRI (Mosert, Argentina, and
Buresova, Czech Republic). Data from the Ebro (Spain) station are used to study
the variation of D1 with solar activity and season (Buresova, Czech Republic,
D. Altadill, Mosert, Argentina, and Amarante, Italy/Spain) as a starting point
for a better description of this parameter in IRI. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.3in'>Evaluating IRI
with data from Brazilian ionosonde stations near the magnetic equator and near
the anomaly crests, Batista and Abdu (Brazil) find that in general the URSI
maps provide better foF2 predictions than the CCIR maps. The largest
discrepancies are found at nighttime near the equator. This could be due to the
fixed epoch used for the magnetic field in IRI whereas the Brazilian data
stretch over 15 years. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The utility of the Neural Networks (NN) technique
for ionospheric modeling was illustrated with NN models for foF1 (Jacobs and
Poole, South Africa) and for foF2 (Oyeyemi, Nigeria and Poole, South Africa).
Fully developed these could be candidate models for future replacements of the
CCIR-type peak parameter maps. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.3in'>The storm
effects on the different IRI F peak and bottomside parameters at mid-latitudes
were studied by Buresova (Czech Republic), Mosert (Argentina), Altadill (Spain)
and Amarante (Spain/Italy). They find the strongest effects for foF2 and TEC
and a close correlation of the temporal variations of the effects on these two
parameters. Similarly the effects on B0 and on the slab thickness are closely
correlated and of similar magnitude. The storm effects in the F1 region are
weaker than in the F2 region and almost always negative. Independent of the
sign of the F2 region magnetic storm effect, the effect on the electron density
at F1 region heights is prevailingly negative and shows substantial seasonal
dependencies at European<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>middle
latitudes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.3in'>Regarding
spread-F probability models it was decided to include the South American model
(Abdu, Brazil) in the next version of IRI. The hope is that this will initiate
comparisons with other longitude zones and the development of a global model.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b><u>Topside and Plasmasphere:</u></b><span
style='font-weight:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Efforts continue to improve the IRI model in the region above 700 km
where IRI overestimates topside sounder measurements. Different approaches have
been reported at earlier meetings based on constraining specific model
parameters and are now being studied for future inclusion in IRI (Coisson,
Italy; Iwamoto, Japan; Bilitza, USA; Reinisch, USA; Gulyaeva, Russia). The
long-term goal is to establish a database of topside scale height measurements
combining space and ground data and to develop a new global model for this
parameter. The improvement of the upper topside profile is also of critical
importance for merging IRI with a plasmasphere model<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>(e.g. GCPM model of Gallagher et al., 2000). GPS-related
modeling efforts were discussed by Cilliers (South Africa) for the South
African region and by Oyama (Japan) based on the nearly 1000 GPS receivers in
Japan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b><u>Ion Composition:</u></b><span
style='font-weight:normal'> Watanabe (Japan) presented a model for the ion
transition height (O<sup>+</sup> to light ions) that he had developed with
Marinov and Kutiev (Bulgaria) based on a Chapman-type profile analysis of
Alouette and ISIS topside sounder data. The model describes variations with
local time, season, geomagnetic latitude, solar flux (F10.7), and geomagnetic
activity (Kp). Significant differences are found in comparisons with IRI, which
need to be further investigated with other data sources.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b><u>Electron Temperature:</u></b><span
style='font-weight:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Using
Akebono data in conjunction with theoretical simulations Oyama and Watanabe
(Japan) studied plasmaspheric processes during quiet and disturbed times. Both
studies relied on the empirical model for the plasmaspheric electron
temperatures that they had developed together with Kutiev (Bulgaria) based on
the Akebono data. It was decided to include this very useful model in the next
version of IRI.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b><u>Ion Temperature:</u></b><span
style='font-weight:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>First
results from an effort to develop an ion temperature model based on ACTIVE data
were reported by Triskova (Czech Republic). She presented a first version of a
global Ti model for high solar activity and finds that at high latitudes the
current IRI model systematically overestimates the ion temperature
measurements.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><b><u>Ion Drift:</u></b><span
style='font-weight:normal'><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Scherliess (USA) described two drift models that might be of interest
for IRI: (1) The disturbance model describes the storm-time effects on the
equatorial ion drift including short-lived prompt penetration electric fields
as well as longer-lived disturbance dynamo electric fields. (2) The second
model is a description of the global ion drift in terms of spherical harmonics
based on satellite and incoherent scatter data. Both models were accepted for
inclusion into the next version of IRI.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Abraham (USA) discussed the use
of IRI for the data analysis of future ocean salinity satellite missions
(Aquarius, SMOS). Ionospheric densities are required for the corrections of the
L-band signal as well as for the elimination of ionospheric emissions. Coetzee
(South Africa) reported about the many applications of IRI by South African
agencies including, for example, direction finding, HF frequency predictions
and path analysis. He stressed the important role of these techniques in the
fight against crime, drug trafficking, and political instability on the African
continent. </p>
