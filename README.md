#IRI
This is a fork of the International Reference Ionosphere.
This repository was created to provide the following features:
- [x] Providing an up-to-date git repository that follows the 
[official release](http://irimodel.org/)
- [ ] A refactorization of IRI into fortran90. This allows for much
cleaner code using modules and derived types.
- [ ] A python interface into IRI to facilitate use in the python
language.
